# Textbooks

Always check with your professor before purchasing textbooks.  Although the book may be marked as "Required" on the course page, not every professor will force you to use it.


### Check the School Library

Your college library may have your textbook on reserve.  If you do not mind studying in the library, this is a good place to start.


### Search for a PDF Version

Do a Google search for "[textbook] pdf".  For example, searching "Random Textbook pdf" may procure links to free pdf versions of the textbook you need.  However, **beware of scams**.  If a site asks for your credit card before taking you to a pdf download, _do not use the site_.
