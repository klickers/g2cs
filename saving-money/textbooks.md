# Textbooks

## Before Buying

- **Check with your professor before purchasing textbooks**.  Although the book may be marked as "Required" on the course page, not every professor will actually require you to use it.
- **Check former students' reviews of your professor on [Rate My Professors](https://ratemyprofessors.com)**.  Some of the students may write that the professor does not require you to use the textbook.  If so, consider saving your money.


## Getting a Copy

### Check the School Library

Your college library may have your textbook on course reserve.  If you do not mind studying in the library, this is a good place to start.


### Search for a PDF Version

Try to find a free online version of the textbook first.

- Do a Google search for "[textbook] PDF".  For example, searching "Random Textbook PDF" may procure links to free PDF versions of Random Textbook.  However, **beware of scams**.  If a site asks for your credit card before taking you to a PDF download, _do not use the site_.
- Go to [http://gen.lib.rus.ec/](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/) and search for a PDF version of your textbook on the site.
