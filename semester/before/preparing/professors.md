# Professors

***

Not all classes or professors are created equal, although they are supposed to be.  To learn more about what former students think about the professor you are about to take, check out [Rate My Professors](https://ratemyprofessors.com).

Important parts of a professor's reviews on [Rate My Professors](https://ratemyprofessors.com), besides the obvious rating:

- **Number of ratings/reviews**.  A professor who has a 1/5 out of one rating may not be as terrible as a professor who has 2/5 out of thirty ratings.  Sample size matters.
- **% that "Would Take Again"**.  This statistic is located right under the professor's name, and shows what percentage of students would take the professor's classes again.
- **Level of Difficulty**.  This number shows up next to the "Would take again" percentage, and shows how students rate the professor's class based on how difficult it is to pass.  The higher the number, the more difficult it will be to obtain a good grade.
- **Top Tags**.  Want to know if a professor gives extra credit, assigns lots of homework, or is kind and caring?  Check the Top Tags section under the previous two ratings for this information.

## Our RateMyProfessors Recommendations

We recommend finding a professor who meets the following criteria:

- Overall rating for humanities, social sciences, etc:  **above 4/5**
- Overall rating for STEM subjects:  **above 3/5**
- Would take again rating: **above 60%**
- Level of Difficulty ranking:  **under 4.0**

Be sure to **read students' reviews** of a professor as well.  There is a lot of information you can glean from them.

## Beware

Here are some of the types of professors you should stay away from **no matter what** (unless they're the only one teaching the class you _absolutely need_ to take):

- **Professors who don't know how to explain things**.  This is especially true for STEM subjects, although of course you may choose to go to your campus' free tutoring services or utilize the Internet for help.  In a subject like math, however, one danger of a professor who cannot explain things is that s/he may not accept alternative problem-solving proccesses - although they lead to the same answer - as a correct solution to a problem.
- **Professors who are not patient with students, or ridicule students who need help**.  It actually still happens.  The reason to avoid these types of professors is pretty obvious, so we will not go into further detail here.
- **Professors who are ridiculously strict graders**.  Note the "ridiculously".  Professors who are strict graders do not necessarily need to be avoided, especially if they are helpful and will tell you exactly what they expect from you.  However, a _ridiculously_ strict professor is someone who may take 10% off your grade for missing a comma in your essay, for example.

## Be Cautious

Here are some characteristics of professors you do not _need_ to avoid, but should consider when choosing which course section to take:

- **Professors who are late graders**.  The caveat with this type of professor is that you often won't know how well you're doing in the course until you're nearly done with it.  On the other hand, they may be easy graders.
